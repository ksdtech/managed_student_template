managed_student_template - PackageMaker projects for locally-managed
student images on OS X 10.4.

Source files for PackageMaker to create new student account,
copy new student User Template ("English.student.lproj")
and install login hook and custom python applications.

1. Prerequisites on target machine:

OS 10.4.11
Python 2.6.5
wxPython 2.8.11


2. "scripts" folder contains two postflight scripts, "postflight_full" and
"postflight_small", that will build the managed preferences and install them
using dscl for OS X 10.4.

3. "payloads" folder contains roots for package payloads
 - "empty" is for the payload-free build
 - "small" is for the student template only
 - "full" is for the full install (student template AND the iHook and 
 custom python applications)
 
To create the payload, use Apple Remote Desktop to copy pref items, 
such as those in "Other Prefs" to:

System/Library/User Template/English.student.lproj/Library/Preferences

inside the "small" or "full" payload folders.  Make sure that permissions
are set up as recommended by PackageMaker.

4. "pm_projects" folder contains the PackageMaker 3.0 documents that specify
the builds
 - "payload_free.pmdoc" is for the "empty" payload
